### How to run:
```sh
rustup run nightly $HOME/.cargo/bin/wasm-pack build --target web && rollup ./main.js --format iife --file ./pkg/bundle.js && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
It is expected that you have a setup with wasm-pack, rollup and python installed.
Since wasm-pack doesn't have a nightly version at the moment, you have to hack around that by using `rustup run nightly`.
